## What is a Warestack workflow?

A workflow in Warestackâ€™s context is an automated process that simplifies tasks in cloud computing and software development. 

> It handles the orchestration of cloud resources and integration with providers (like `Amazon Web Services` or the `Google Cloud Platform`) by utilizing code and repositories with actions (like `GitHub Action`), deploying and configuring systems (like `databases`), and setting up their dependencies.

:bulb: Workflows are specified in YAML files and can be triggered by events like push actions, pull requests, issue creations, or manually. They can also be scheduled to run at specific times.

### :red_circle: What are the problems?

1. High complexity: A ton of integrations with manual hardcoded configurations.
2. Indefficient operations: Error resolution requires billable time, plus high tech expertise is needed to setup.
3. Hard to observe and fix: Jumping from site to site to debug, go to Google or Stack Overflow to ask for help.

### :green_circle:  What is our solution?
