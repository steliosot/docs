**Welcome to the Warestack data room. In this space you can find useful information about our team and product.**

## What is a Warestack workflow?

A workflow in Warestackâ€™s context is an automated process that simplifies tasks in cloud computing and software development. It handles the orchestration of cloud resources, integration with providers (like Amazon Web Services) by utilizing code and repositories with actions (like GitHub), deploying and configuring systems (like databases), and setting up their dependencies.

:bulb: Workflows are defined in YAML files and triggered by events such as push, pull requests, or issue creation, or they can be scheduled to run at specific times.

### :red_circle: What are the problems?

We solve the workflow operation puzzle! Setting up workflows is complex and costly. We simplify and reduce costs by providing workflow compositions and self-hosted solutions with observability.

1. High complexity: A ton of integrations with manual hardcoded configurations.
2. Indefficient operations: Error resolution requires billable time, plus high tech expertise is needed to setup.
3. Hard to observe and fix: Jumping from site to site to debug, go to Google or Stack Overflow to ask for help.

### :blue_circle:  What is our solution?

1. Low-code copilot: We provide a custom LLM to help you compose and optimize workflows in minutes.
2. Self-managed runners: Self and cloud hosted workfklow runners to control cost, performance and compliance.
3. Holistic observability: A unique dashboard to manage, fix and operate multi-cloud wofklows.
