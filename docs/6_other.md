### :fontawesome-solid-rocket:  How do we achieve that?

* We abstract workflow composition to modular jobs to ensure scalability and maintainability for example using existing GitHub marketplace actions. 
* Our runners can execute workflows at infrastructure cost, and not in billable time units as GitHub does.
* Our users manage runner costs and limits while ensuring compliance e.g. execute workflows in their region or private networks and not wherever a GitHub runner relies. 
* The copilot is the icing on the top, guiding users to compose and operate workflows by fitting modern UX expectations.
