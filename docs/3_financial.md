## How are we going to make money?

1. We start with a freemium for solopreneurs and early stage startups  (workflow generation from user GitHub codebases). 

2. We hook them to progress with custom runners and AI-based observability (subscription based). This is ideal for development teams that need self-managed solutions (run at infra cost and reduced expenses).

3. Our ultimate goal is B2B, for enterprises that need a custom developer PaaS tailored to their organization needs. They can customize and share workflows inside their organization, access dedicated support, documentation and advanced features.
